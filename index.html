    <h1 class="center">about me</h1>

    <p class="center">my name is kal jones, im 20 years old 
    and I have always had an interest in computers 
    the code behind how they work. I found code 
    nation through a company called ingus. 
    They are helping me to find work and with my 
    interest in the industry but with very little 
    experience they suggested this course that 
    I am currently doing. 
    My hobbies include reading, singing, 
    playing games on my xbox and 
    playing dungeons and dragons.</p>
