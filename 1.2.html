    <h2 class="center">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and 
    change approach as needed </h2>

    <p class="center">making the website was fairly simple in my opinion 
    using VS code (visual studio code) most of the lines of code needed 
    was already there and implementing the css code was simple too. 
    Also using trello to help orgenis what i had to do also helped me 
    out a lot</p>

    <h2 class="center">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>

    <p class="center">I think that VS code is a good program to use 
    especially for beginners to coding, like me. It's simple to use 
    and easy to understand the program knows what language you are 
    using to code and will auto fill most of the strands and that 
    it can be used on any operating system makes it more accessible.</p>
