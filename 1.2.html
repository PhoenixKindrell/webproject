    <h2 class="center">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and 
    change approach as needed </h2>

    <p class="center">making the website was fairly simple in my opinion 
    using VS code (visual studio code) most of the lines of code needed 
    was already there and implementing the css code was simple too. 
    Also using trello to help orgenis what i had to do also helped me 
    out a lot</p>

    <h2 class="center">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>

    <p class="center">I think that VS code is a good program to use 
    especially for beginners to coding, like me. It's simple to use 
    and easy to understand the program knows what language you are 
    using to code and will auto fill most of the strands and that 
    it can be used on any operating system makes it more accessible.</p>

    <h2 class="center">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>

    <p class="center">my website is simple and easy to read, it is easy to 
    navigate but that is also probably the weak points about my project 
    there are a few things I would improve but for a first attempt I am 
    happy with what I made.</p>

    <h2 class="center">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

    <p class="center">If I were to do this project again I would probably 
    add more details to the pages and I would add some animated gifs 
    or some links connected to images.</p>

    <h2 class="center">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

    <p class="center">I am confident that the website I have 
    produced meets the requirements for the project.</p>

    <h2 class="center">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
    productivity and efciency</h2>

    <p class="center">the benefits of working on my own productivity 
    wise is I can do what I want with the project and I can take my 
    time with the project. The drawbacks are that working on my own 
    will probably take longer then if I was working in a group on 
    this project.</p>

    <h2 class="center">3.2  Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency</h2>

    <p class="center">one of the ways iv improved efficiency is by making 
    my css code apply on all pages and keeping it simple is the only way 
    I can think of to make it more efficient to use in my website.</p>

    <h2 class="center">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>

    <p class="center">if I were to do this project differently i would 
    probably do the code in a team and then put the personal touches 
    like images and text styles and css code on my own to make my website 
    different to the team I was working with.</p>

    <h2 class="center">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

    <p class="center">when im testing a new line of code i tend to use 
    trial and error and I would keep altering the code till it works 
    and/or im happy with how it looks.</p>
